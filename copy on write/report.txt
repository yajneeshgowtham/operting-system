Report 1:

Here we need to print the pte index and the pte and physical address for pte

so with the help of freewalk function we create a vmprint function in vm.c

we include the definition in defs.h 

and write the function vmprint in vm.c

helper function is used to print level wise

first we print a level at parent and then we go to the child lvel using pte and function PTE2PA 

and recursively call the function.


Report 2:

Here we need to stop the allocation of size which happens in sys_sbrk() 

which is present in sysproc.c in kernel

we need to stop the implementation of growproc() which is called in sys_sbrk()

so we get the errors which are present in trap.c

and vm.c the function uvmunmap 

we need to add the comment of the thirs file

Report 3:

here instead o fusing the growproc() fumction we need to 

write the function before the errors in trap.c

so we do alzy allocation of 1 page size if we get a error 

so we use the function is uvmalloc to help us
